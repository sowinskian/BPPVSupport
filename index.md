## Welcome to the support page for my app!

This app was created to aid in the at-home diagnosis and treatment of Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is meant for educational and informational purposes only. Any diagnoses offered are unofficial and should be treated as such.While the maneuvers detailed within are widely regarded as safe, you should not attempt them if you are suffering from a neck or back injury. You should always perform these maneuvers in the presence of someone who can assist if needed.


If you have any questions or concerns about the app, feel free to email me at [andrewsowinski@me.com](mailto:andrewsowinski@me.com)  

If you have any medical concerns, consult a doctor immediately
